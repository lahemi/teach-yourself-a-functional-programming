Did away with all the silly, irrelevant crud.

The assignment is done using Go 1.3, run on CentOS 7.

If you do not have Go installed, see
http://golang.org/doc/install for instructions.


The input data for problems 18 and 67 is placed in inputdata.go
so that I do not have to, less importantly, bother with reading
any files, and much more importantly, worry about placing and
locating those data files somewhere on system since they are
now compiled as a part of the program.


Alternative solutions using other languages might be added later on.
